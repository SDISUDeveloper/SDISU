    <h1>We are THE LOCALS</h1>
    <p>Teachers, students, artists, musicians, engineers, baristas, brewers, individuals, couples, families. On match days we go hard for the full 90 minutes and lose our voices to chants and songs.</p>
    <p>Our mascot is San Diego's legendary and very real town dog of the 1880s. “Bum” was loved by everyone, owned by no one. We’ve got heritage. The Locals were formed five years ago to support San Diego Loyal SC. Now we’re helping to build our SDFC future!</p>
    <p>We stand up for our community, inclusivity and social justice. We celebrate our LGBTQ+ members. Black Lives Matter. Viva La Raza! Long Live the US Open Cup!</p>
    <p>We prioritize learning the songs—regardless of language—and elevate our shared culture. We value supporter group independence because sooner or later every team’s leadership needs to hear honest truths that can’t be found in a spreadsheet.</p>
    <p>We love to get to know the players and staff. We put our love and creative energies into awesome tifo displays and creating unique man of the match awards, banners, and songs for our team and individual players. Our tailgates are epic.</p>
    <p>If this sounds like you… you’re a Local. Make new friends, join the fun, do good work!</p>
